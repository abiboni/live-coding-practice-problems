## Duplicate Elements

#### Instructions to Interviewee
Write a function that accepts an array of integers as input. Return true or false depending on whether the array contains a duplicate element or not.

---
#### Hints and Clarifications
- The duplicates can be nonconsecutive.
- Assume there are at least 2 elements in the array.

---
#### Test Data
- `[3, -1, 9, 2, -4, 7, 3, 6, 1, 5]`
- `[1, 9]`
- `[1, 2, 2, 3]`

---
#### Expected Result
```
true
false
true
```

---
#### Additional Prompts
Can you think of a way to solve this without looping over the array? (This will require more advanced knowledge of built-in JS classes and methods.)
